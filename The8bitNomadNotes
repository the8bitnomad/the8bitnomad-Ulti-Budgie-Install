# For anyone wishing to change transparency to their liking, who is new to # this, of the last numbers in any RGBA colour, understand that 0=fully is # transparent and 255=fully opaque. If you wish to change a plank theme to # match your desktop theme, I would suggest using gpick which will give   # you the exact RGBA colour when you hover over it, and just simply copy  # and paste below.  
# Enjoy people...
